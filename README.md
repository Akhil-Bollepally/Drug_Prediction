# Deep Side - A Deep Learning Framework for Drug Side Effect Prediction💊

---

## Project Overview
Deep Side is a **Deep Learning–based Drug Side Effect Prediction System**designed to predict possible side effects of drugs using biological and chemical features.

The project integrates **Deep Learning models** with a **Django web application**, allowing users to interact with the system through a browser-based interface. The goal is to assist in early identification of
drug side effects, which can support safer drug development and clinical decision-making.

This project is developed as a **college academic project** with an emphasis on practical implementation and real-world relevance.

## System Workflow
1. User logs into the web application  
2. Drug-related data is provided as input  
3. Features are processed and passed to the deep learning model  
4. The model predicts possible side effects  
5. Results are displayed through the web interface

## Dataset & Model Note
Pre-trained model files and large datasets are **not included in this repository**
due to GitHub file size limitations.

Models are loaded locally during execution, which follows **standard industry and
academic best practices**.
